* I stopped on working on the Python code due to lack of time. I think it is important to get some results out for the final project as opposed to get the results fine tuned

NONE OF THESE CODE WORK. I AM STILL WORKING ON THEM
The libraries are not working and I am still working on loading the files

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```
